# 100 Days of RTL

Welcome to the "100 Days of RTL" repository! In this project, we aim to complete 100 interesting RTL (Register Transfer Level) projects over the course of 100 days. This repository is a journey to explore digital design, Verilog, VHDL, and hardware description languages through hands-on projects.

## About the Project

The goal of this project is to engage with RTL design concepts and digital logic in a practical way. Each day, we will work on a new RTL project, covering various topics such as combinational logic, sequential circuits, state machines, arithmetic circuits, memory elements, etc.

## How to Use This Repository

Each day's project will be organized into its own folder within the repository. Inside each project folder, you will find the RTL source code, testbench, and any necessary documentation. Follow these steps to navigate through the repository:

1. Browse the repository folders to find the project of the day you're interested in.
2. Open the project folder to access the Verilog or VHDL source code and testbench.
3. Review the README and documentation provided in each project folder for more details about the project and its functionality.

Feel free to explore the projects in any order, and don't hesitate to experiment and modify the code to learn more and create your variations!

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/Ajit-007/100-days-of-rtl.git`.
2. Navigate to the project of the day you want to explore using the appropriate folder structure.
3. Inside the project folder, you'll find the RTL source code, testbench, and documentation.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for new projects, improvements to existing projects, or documentation enhancements, please feel free to submit a pull request. Let's make this repository a collaborative learning resource for everyone interested in RTL design.

## Disclaimer

This repository is intended for educational purposes only. The projects provided are not necessarily optimized for production use and are meant for learning and experimentation.
